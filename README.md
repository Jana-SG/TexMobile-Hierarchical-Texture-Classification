# TexMobile-Hierarchical-Texture-Classification
TexMobile is a hierarchical convolutional neural network for texture-aware campus scene classification. The model integrates transfer learning from MobileNetV2 with multi-level coarse-to-fine classification and texture feature encoding to improve recognition performance in structurally and visually complex environments.
